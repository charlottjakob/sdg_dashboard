As formulated by the TCFD, the industry  which Coloplast is in, is not considered  to have high exposure to climate  change risks. However, the preliminary  risk assessment performed by the  working group reveal potential long- term exposures to both physical and  transitional risks within our supply chain  and manufacturing.      Examples of physical risks include  increase of extreme weather events  such as flooding or wildfires, which  potentially could affect our supply chain  and manufacturing.     Examples of transitional risks include  carbon taxes and market changes.  Coloplast experiences increased focus  on environmental performance of  products from users as well as  authorities.

As part of a regulated industry,  Coloplast’s products and quality  management system live up to strict  regulatory standards established by  authorities worldwide such as the FDA,  Japanese Ministry of Health, the  International Standardization  Organization, and the European  Commission. Compliance to these  standards is verified on site through  external audits by independent auditors  and Notified Bodies.     All Coloplast sites involved in Design,  Production, packaging and Central  Distribution are certified according to  one or more of the following standards:  ISO9001, ISO13485, MDSAP, MDD. This  year, Coloplast had 74 full day audits on  quality and system conformity, which is  lower than the total of 94 audit days last  year.

All animal testing used by Coloplast are  performed by Good Laboratory Practice  certified laboratories. This year,  Coloplast used 758 animals for testing in  relation to pre-clinical safety  documentation, which is less than half of  the animal tests last year.

      "Page 31, Paragraph 470: Data for Scope 1 and 2 emissions covers all Coloplast production sites (Denmark, Hungary, France, US, China and Costa  Rica), selected offices (Denmark and US) and global distribution centres (Germany, Hungary and US). New sites are  included in the reporting on the date of takeover from the developer (owned sites) or by the first day of occupancy  (leased/rented sites). Data on Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is based on consumption handled in air cleaning  systems. Data on Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) gasses is obtained from local registrations or invoices. Emissions from power  consumption are based on International Energy Agency country specific GHG emission factors, not including production  and transmission losses. Emissions from the other consumption categories are based on emission factors from IPCC  (HFC's), International Energy Agency (district heating) and the Danish Energy Agency (natural gas and oil). Emission per  unit produced is measured as total emissions (scope 1 + 2) in tonnes CO2e divided by the number of units produced by  Coloplast. Emission per revenue is measured as total emissions (scope 1 + 2) in tonnes CO2e divided by revenue in  million DKK.     GHG quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine  emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases. Therefore scope 3 reporting is  rounded to nearest hundred and is limited to include six categories relevant to our operations:  1.   Raw materials: Covers all ingoing raw materials registered in Coloplast’s production data management system.  Does not include OEM/contract manufactured goods, production equipment and other capital goods, processing  aids and other supporting materials.\n",
      "Page 31, Paragraph 471: 2.   Transportation of goods: Based on data from suppliers. Covers all distribution internally in Coloplast as well as  distribution of finished goods from warehouses to customers in Emerging Markets. Only suppliers with a spend  above 2% of total distribution costs are included. In 2019/20, emissions from transportation of goods accounts for  98% of spends.\n",
      "Page 31, Paragraph 472: 3.   Business travels: Based on data from Coloplast's global travel agents and calculated by using the VDR standard for  calculation of corporate travel. Data from Coloplast's global travel agent accounts for 67% of total business air  travel costs and the remaining 33% has been extrapolated based on the average amount of CO2e per spend from  Coloplast's global travel agent to ensure completeness of data.\n",
      "Page 31, Paragraph 473: 4.   Leased company cars: Covers emissions from all leased company cars that are registered in Coloplast's Sharepoint  databases, which is based on information from leasing providers and from local affiliates. Emissions are calculated  using manufacturer information on average CO2 emissions per car per km and, where available actual  consumption data, from local fleets timed the average distance traveled per car. To accommodate actual driving  patterns, Coloplast adds 30%.\n",
      "Page 31, Paragraph 474: 5.   Energy consumption in sales offices, subsidiaries and local/regional warehouses: Covers all sales offices, subsidiaries  and regional warehouses, which primarily are leased. Emissions from sales offices, subsidiaries and warehouses are  based on the number of FTE's working here and is calculated using a conversion factor of 54,6 kg CO2 per FTE per  m2 from the Danish Energy Agency.\n",
      "Page 31, Paragraph 475: 6.   Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM): Covers GHG emissions from outsourced production, e.g. finished goods  produced by external suppliers under the Coloplast brand. Emissions from outsourced production is calculated using  Coloplast' average CO2 emission per produced finished good timed with the amount of finished goods produced by  external supplier.\n",

Listening  to her sister’s problems, Elise conceives the idea of  the world’s first adhesive ostomy bag.    Based on Elise’s idea, Aage Louis-Hansen, a civil  engineer and plastics manufacturer, and his wife  Johanne Louis-Hansen, a trained nurse, created  the ostomy bag. A bag that does not leak, giving  Thora – and thousands of people like her – the  chance to live the life they want.   A simple solution that makes a difference.   Today, our business includes Ostomy Care,  Continence Care, Wound & Skin Care and  Interventional Urology. We operate globally   and employ about 12,500 employees.\n",
